# virtualhost.sh
#
# A fancy little script to setup a new virtualhost in Mac OS X.
#
# If you want to delete a virtualhost that you've created, you need to:
#
# sudo ./virtualhost.sh --delete <site>
#
# where <site> is the site name you used when you first created the host.
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.30
#
# - Fix deleting hosts when SKIP_ETC_HOSTS="yes"
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.29
#
# - Bugfix to show hidden prompt.
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.28
#
# - You can set SKIP_BROWSER="yes" to disable the browser launching. This
#   changes the BATCH_MODE behaviour from 1.26 which didn't launch the
#   browser with BATCH_MODE="yes".
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.27
#
# - When looking for a document root, use find to traverse into the
#   DOC_ROOT_PREFIX folder to a maximum depth of MAX_SEARCH_DEPTH.
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.26
#
# - Added BATCH_MODE setting to auto-answer questions (Github issue #19)
# - Added SKIP_VERSION_CHECK setting to skip the version check.
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.25
#
# - Added --list option to list any virtualhosts that have been setup
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.24 (courtesy of http://github.com/aersoy)
#
# - Detect Symfony projects;
# - Changes to deleting virtual hosts:
#    * Check existence of virtual host before asking for confirmation to delete
#    * Ask for deletion of log files during --delete;
# - Default port for virtual host is a variable ($APACHE_PORT);
# - Allow for other browsers such as Google Chrome to be used when opening up
#   the virtual host after it's completed.
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.23
# - Fix a bug when automatically rerunning script using sudo.
#   (Issue #11 reported and fixed by Jake Smith <Jake.Smith92>)
# - Fix a bug that prevented the document root from being deleted when a virtual
#   host was deleted.
#   (Issue #12 reported and fixed by Jake Smith <Jake.Smith92>)
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.22
# - It is now possible to use this script in environments like FreeBSD. Some
#   new configuration variables support this such as SKIP_ETC_HOSTS,
#   HOME_PARTITION, and SKIP_DOCUMENT_ROOT_CHECK.
# - If you're doing Ruby on Rails, Merb, and other Rack-based development,
#   the script looks for a public folder in your document root, and will
#   optionally use that (assuming the use of Phusion Passenger:
#   <http://modrails.com/>)
# - Support spaces in your document root. (Issue #10 by ryanilg.creative)
# - If you forget to run with sudo, you no longer have to re-run.
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.21
# - virtualhost.sh now checks to see if a newer version is available! Amazing!
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.20
# - [Issue #7] You can now have site-specific logs for each virtual host. See
#   the configuration variables PROMPT_FOR_LOGS and ALWAYS_CREATE_LOGS for
#   additional controls.
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.19
# - [Issue #1] On Leopard, the first request to the new virtual host would fail.
#   Have remedied this by making the first request in the script, in addition to
#   the sleep 1 command.
# - [Issue #4] Some users reported an error originating from a missing group.
#   Looks like Leopard doesn't create a group with the same name as the user like
#   previous versions (and most other Unix-variants!) do. It was never a problem
#   for me because my user account was created on Mac OS X 10.0, and has been
#   migrated from machine to machine and with every upgrade, and my "patrick"
#   group has remained. (Thanks to Matt Sephton for reporting and providing a
#   patch!)
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.18
# - [Issue #2] Add a new option $OPEN_COMMAND to specify which app should be
#   used when launching the virtual host. See below for examples.
# - [Issue #3] Make sure sudo is used to run the command so that we know the
#   actual user's user name.
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.17
# - You can now store any configuration values in ~/.virtualhost.sh.conf.
#   This way, you can update the script without losing your settings.
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.16
# - Add feature to support a ServerAlias using a wildcard DNS host. See the
#   Wiki at http://code.google.com/p/virtualhost-sh/wiki/Wildcard_Hosts
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.15
# - Fix a bug in host_exists() that caused it never to work (thanks to Daniel
#   Jewett for finding that).
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.14
# - Fix check in /etc/hosts to better match the supplied virtualhost.
# - Fix check for existing folder in your Sites folder.
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.06
# - Support for Leopard. In fact, this version only supports Leopard, and 1.05
#   will be the last version for Tiger and below.
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.05
# - The $APACHECTL variable wasn't been used. (Thanks to Thomas of webtypes.com)
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.04
# - An oversight in the change in v1.03 caused the ownership to be incorrect for
#   a tree of folders that was created. If your site folder is a few levels deep
#   we now fix the ownership properly of each nested folder.  (Thanks again to
#   Michael Allan for pointing this out.)
#
# - Improved the confirmation page for when you create a new virtual host. Not
#   only is it more informative, but it is also much more attractive.
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.03
# - When creating the website folder, we now create all the intermediate folders
#   in the case where a user sets their folder to something like
#   clients/project_a/mysite. (Thanks to Michael Allan for pointing this out.)
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.02
# - Allow for the configuration of the Apache configuration path and the path to
#   apachectl.
#
# WHAT'S NEW IN v1.01
# - Use absolute path to apachectl, as it looks like systems that were upgraded
#   from Jaguar to Panther don't seem to have it in the PATH.

# If you are using this script on a production machine with a static IP address,
# and you wish to setup a "live" virtualhost, you can change the following IP
# address to the IP address of your machine.
#
IP_ADDRESS="127.0.0.1"

# By default, this script places files in /Users/[you]/Sites. If you would like
# to change this, like to how Apple does things by default, uncomment the
# following line:
#
#DOC_ROOT_PREFIX="/Library/WebServer/Documents"

# Configure the apache-related paths
#
APACHE_CONFIG="/private/etc/apache2"
APACHECTL="/usr/sbin/apachectl"

# If you wish to change the default application that gets launched after the
# virtual host is created, define it here:
OPEN_COMMAND="/usr/bin/open"

# If you want to use a different browser than Safari, define it here:
#BROWSER="Firefox"
#BROWSER="WebKit"
#BROWSER="Google Chrome"

# If defined, a ServerAlias os $1.$WILDCARD_ZONE will be added to the virtual
# host file. This is useful if you, for example, have setup a wildcard domain
# either on your own DNS server or using a server like dyndns.org. For example,
# if my local IP of 10.0.42.42 is static (which can still be achieved using a
# well-configured DHCP server or an Apple Airport Extreme 802.11n base station)
# and I create a host on dyndns.org of patrickdev.dyndns.org with wildcard
# hostnames turned on, then defining my WILDCARD_ZONE to "patrickdev.dyndns.org"
# will enable access to my virtual host from any machine on the network. Note
# that this would also work with a public IP too, and the virtual hosts on your
# machine would be accessible to anyone on the internets.
#WILDCARD_ZONE="my.wildcard.host.address"

# A feature to specify a custom log location within your site's document root
# was requested, and so you will be prompted about this when you create a new
# virtual host. If you do not want to be prompted, set the following to "no":
PROMPT_FOR_LOGS="no"

# If you do not want to be prompted, but you do always want to have the site-
# specific logs folder, set PROMPT_FOR_LOGS="no" and enable this:
ALWAYS_CREATE_LOGS="yes"

# By default, log files will be created in DOCUMENT_ROOT/logs. If you wish to
# override this to a static location, you can do so here.
#LOG_FOLDER="/var/log/httpd"

# If you have an atypical setup, and you don't need or want entries in your
# /etc/hosts file, you can set the following option to "yes".
SKIP_ETC_HOSTS="no"

# If you are running this script on a platform other than Mac OS X, your home
# partition is going to be different. If so, change it here.
HOME_PARTITION="/Users"

# If your environment has a different default DocumentRoot, and you don't want
# to be nagged about "fixing" your DocumentRoot, set this to "yes".
SKIP_DOCUMENT_ROOT_CHECK="no"

# If Apache works on a different port than the default 80, set it here
APACHE_PORT="80"

# Batch mode (all prompting will assume Yes). Any value will activate this. Can
# be set here, in ~/.virtualhost.sh.conf, or on the command line, like:
# BATCH_MODE=yes virtualhost.sh mysite
#BATCH_MODE="yes"

# If you're satisfied with the version you have and do not wish to be reminded
# of a new version, add the following line to your ~/.virtualhost.sh.conf file.
#SKIP_VERSION_CHECK="yes"

# We now will search your $DOC_ROOT_PREFIX for a matching subfolder using find.
# By default, we will go two levels deep so that it doesn't take too long. If
# you have a really complex structure, you may need to increase this.
MAX_SEARCH_DEPTH=2

# Set to "yes" if you don't have a browser (headless) or don't want the site
# to be launched in your browser after the virtualhost is setup.
#SKIP_BROWSER="yes"

# You can now store your configuration directions in a ~/.virtualhost.sh.conf
# file so that you can download new versions of the script without having to
# redo your own settings.
